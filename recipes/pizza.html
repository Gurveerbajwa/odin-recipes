    <h1>Pizza</h1>
    <img src="images/pizza.jpeg" alt="Pizza">
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, <br/> baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.</p>
    <p>One of the simplest and most traditional pizzas is the Margherita, which is topped with tomatoes or tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. <br/> Popular legend relates that it was named for Queen Margherita, wife of Umberto I, who was said to have liked its mild fresh flavour and <br/> to have also noted that its topping colours—green, white, and red—were those of the Italian flag.</p>
